# Northcoders News API

This repository is for a RESTful api built with Javascript in Node.js, and uses PostGreSQL as a database. The API is built using the Express.js framework, and was developed using **Test Driven Development (TDD)**, using both Jest and Supertest packages to test end-to-end.

The database features the following tables:

- users
- articles
- comments
- topics

All available endpoints and their responses are listed [here](https://dp-api.cyclic.app/api). This API is hosted on Cyclic and uses ElephantSQL to host the database.
